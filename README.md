# Stock-Program-Project
C++ Stock Program Project

This project is a Stock Program Project written in the software language C++.

There are two PDFs uploaded, (1) and (2), that have the instructions regarding this project.

To run this project, please consider all the files, 3 in total, before compilation.


**PLEASE NOTE**:
This program is not perfect - it has some "loops" where the codes break.
Here are some instances:
1. You must buy a stock before attempting to manage your portfolio.

2. When the program asks the user to press "Y or N" to proceed, you must literally write in Y or N, in capital letters.
Doing so otherwise will break to program.

3. You must buy the stock as stated in the stock file name. For example, if the stock you wanted to purchase was VNET,
you must write 'VNET' rather than 'vnet'.

4. When purchasing a stock, please follow the directions. It must be name of stock, price, and amount, or however in the format that
the program asks.
So for example, if you were to purchase a stock, say VNET, you would input:
'VNET_50_50', where the _ indicate spaces.

The code will attempted to be fixed in time.
